Automated changelog tool for preparing releases with lots of customization options.
Changie aims to be a universal tool for any project language or style but limiting itself to changelogs and version management.

## Features
* File based changelog management keeps your commit history and release notes separate.
* Track changes while you work while the knowledge is fresh.
* Extensive [configuration options](config/index.md) to fit your project.
* Language and framework agnostic using a single go binary.
